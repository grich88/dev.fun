## 🔧 Key Prompts for dev.fun

### Essential Prompts (Copy & Paste)
```markdown
# Initial Setup
Build an on-chain multiplayer coin flip game called "High Stakes Coin Flip Showdown" where:
- Players pay 5 PUMP tokens to join a game round
- Each player takes turns flipping a coin (heads/tails)
- After each "heads", players can choose to "Flip Again" or "Cash Out"
- If a player gets "tails", they bust and are eliminated from the round
- The player with the longest streak of consecutive heads wins the entire pot
- House takes a 5% fee from the pot
- Include a solo mode where one player can play against the house
- Use Solana blockhash for fair, on-chain randomness
- Create a vault system to securely hold player bets until round end
```

```markdown
# Enable devbase
Add devbase integration to enable on-chain transactions:
- Players must pay 5 PUMP tokens to join the game
- Create a secure vault to hold all entry fees
- Enable wallet connection (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Add persistent storage for game state
- Include transaction handling for all player actions
- Set up house wallet for solo mode payouts
- Enable real-time updates when game state changes
```
