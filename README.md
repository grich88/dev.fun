# 🎲 High Stakes Coin Flip Showdown

**dev.fun Casino App Challenge Entry**

A competitive multiplayer on-chain casino game built with dev.fun, featuring both PvP and player-vs-house modes. Players compete to achieve the longest streak of consecutive coin flips while managing risk through strategic cash-out decisions.

## 🎯 Game Concept

### Core Mechanics
- **Multiplayer Mode**: 2+ players compete in rounds with entry fees
- **Solo Mode**: Single player challenges the house
- **Risk Management**: Players decide when to cash out vs. continue flipping
- **Winner Takes All**: Longest streak wins the entire pot
- **Pump.fun Integration**: Uses Pump.fun tokens as game currency

### Game Flow
1. Players pay entry fee (e.g., 5 PUMP tokens)
2. Each player takes turns flipping coins
3. After each "heads", player chooses: Flip Again or Cash Out
4. "Tails" results in immediate bust (elimination)
5. Player with longest streak wins the pot
6. House takes 5% fee from winnings

## 🎮 Game Rules

### Multiplayer Mode
1. **Entry**: Players pay 5 PUMP tokens to join
2. **Turns**: Players take sequential turns
3. **Flipping**: Each flip is 50/50 heads/tails
4. **Streak Building**: Consecutive heads increase streak
5. **Cash Out**: Player can stop anytime to lock streak
6. **Bust**: Tails eliminates player from round
7. **Winner**: Longest streak takes entire pot (minus 5% house fee)

### Solo Mode (vs House)
1. **Bet**: Player bets any amount
2. **Payout**: 2^streak × bet amount
3. **Risk**: Busting loses entire bet
4. **House Edge**: Built into payout structure
